Utilizing ML and NLP, this project analyzes customer reviews on e-commerce platforms, categorizes sentiments, computes ratings, and generates ranking tables for mobile phones. It aims to enhance FMCG product quality and customer satisfaction.

# Product Review Analysis - FlipKart/Amazon

## Overview
This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and categorize customer reviews from e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon. The primary goal is to provide insights into product quality, sentiments, and overall customer satisfaction in the FMCG domain.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- WordCloud

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer reviews for various mobile phones, categorized by aspects like camera, battery, display, value for money, and performance.

## Code Structure
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to gain insights.
- **Pre-Processing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Assigning sentiments (Positive/Negative) based on ratings.
- **Word Frequency Analysis:** Identifying the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.
- **WordCloud:** Creating word clouds to visualize significant terms.
- **Bag of Words Model:** Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Building and evaluating Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models.
- **Results:** Calculating percentage of positive and negative reviews, overall product rankings, and average ratings.
